[1/154] Sonnet 5: Those hours, that with gentle work did frame
  [ 2] The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,
  [ 5] For never-resting time leads summer on
  [ 9] Then were not summer's distillation left,

[2/154] Sonnet 18: Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
  [ 1] Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
  [ 2] Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
  [ 4] And summer's lease hath all too short a date:
  [ 9] But thy eternal summer shall not fade,

[3/154] Sonnet 54: O! how much more doth beauty beauteous seem
  [ 8] When summer's breath their masked buds discloses:
  [13]   And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,

[4/154] Sonnet 56: Sweet love, renew thy force; be it not said
  [ 1] Sweet love, renew thy force; be it not said
  [ 5] So, love, be thou, although to-day thou fill
  [ 8] The spirit of love, with a perpetual dulness.
  [12] Return of love, more blest may be the view;
  [14]   Makes summer's welcome, thrice more wished, more rare.

[5/154] Sonnet 65: Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea
  [ 5] O! how shall summer's honey breath hold out,
  [14]   That in black ink my love may still shine bright.

[6/154] Sonnet 102: My love is strengthen'd, though more weak in seeming
  [ 1] My love is strengthen'd, though more weak in seeming;
  [ 2] I love not less, though less the show appear;
  [ 3] That love is merchandiz'd, whose rich esteeming,
  [ 5] Our love was new, and then but in the spring,
  [ 7] As Philomel in summer's front doth sing,
  [ 9] Not that the summer is less pleasant now
